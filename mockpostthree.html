          <h1>Why I Buy Vinyl</h1>
            <p>I do not buy vinyl because I think "music just sounds better that way." I don't really have an argument as to whether CDs or vinyl sound better, but I do prefer the experience of listening to a record on vinyl.</p>
            <p>I listen to a lot of my music digitally. Having the entirety of my iTunes library in my pocket wherever I go is convenient and I love it. But when I'm walking around with earbuds in, my mind isn't solely focused on the music. To fully appreciate whatever you choose to listen to, you have to devote at least some of your attention to it. Having it so readily available often leads to my library playing as background music for my everyday tasks.</p>
            <p>If I find myself really interested in an album, I buy it on vinyl. In my opinion, playing a record gives the listener the most complete experience. The artwork is bigger, for a start, the and act of actually playing a record takes longer than the efforts associated with playing a CD or songs in a digital library. You almost find it difficult to do anything but listen when you're listening to vinyl. If you allow yourself to become distracted, you'd run out of music after 5 or 6 songs, so you may as well sit there and be prepared to switch to side-b when the time comes.</p>
            <p>Collecting records is also time consuming. But there's really nothing better than walking into a record store and finding the record you've been searching for. There's also events like <a href="http://www.recordstoreday.com/" target="_blank">Record Store Day</a> that bring hordes of people out to record stores trying to find the limited releases before they're gone forever. If you're into having people validate your music taste the record stores are the place to go. You can almost turn it into a game, tyring to find the perfect record to take to the cashier so they give you the face of approval, or the greatly sought after verbal compliment on your choice.</p>
            <p> Walking into a record store makes you feel like you're an active member of the music community. I buy vinyl when I really want to listen to an album...or maybe it's because I want to have a record collection organized in an "autobiographical" fashion like Rob Gordon from High Fidelity? Who knows.</p>
