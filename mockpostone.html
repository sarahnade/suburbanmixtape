          <h1>5 Songs You May Have Missed in 2014</h1>
            <a href="https://soundcloud.com/badsuns/transpose" target="_blank"><h2>Bad Suns - Transpose</h2></a>
              <p>It's very possible that another track from their album "Language & Perspective" titled <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZvFGEE26vE" target="_blank">"Cardiac Arrest"</a> has made its way into your music library. If "Tranpose" or any of the other songs from their debut have not, I would reconsider that, as this band is certainly worth your time.</p>
            <a href="https://soundcloud.com/communionmusic/catfish_kathleen target="_blank""><h2>Catfish and the Bottlemen - Kathleen</h2></a>
              <p>"Kathleen," for me, is one of those songs where the melody in the verses is catchier than those in the chorus. Catfish and the Bottlemen come from Wales and have described their genre as "Xplosive." I'll buy it. Their debut album "The Balcony" has yet to be released in the US yet, but will be available soon after the new year. If you find it hard to wait that long, some additional tracks are available through their <a href="https://soundcloud.com/catfishandthebottlemen" target="_blank">Soundcloud</a> profile.</p>
            <a href="https://soundcloud.com/darlia/animal-kingdom" target="_blank"><h2>Darlia - Animal Kingdom</h2></a>
              <p>Darlia, on occassion, sounds like a British version of Nirvana. That being said, this band certainly has their own identity and doesn't sound like they're recycling the same easy to sell alternative/indie sound, like many others. The entire <a href="https://soundcloud.com/darlia/sets/candyman-ep" target="_blank">Candyman EP</a> that this track comes from is worth checking out. If you enjoy it, it's worth mentioning that they're releasing what they've deemed an 8 track "mini album" in February of 2015.</p>
            <a href="https://soundcloud.com/san-cisco-music/run" target="_blank"><h2>San Cisco - RUN</h2></a>
              <p>I decided to watch San Cisco's 2013 Lollapalooza set on a whim and ended up being very happy that I did. If you find yourself at all familiar with San Cisco it may be a result of their <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bf8Tda6rmi4" target="_blank">popular cover</a> of Daft Punk's "Get Lucky." "RUN" is their most recent single from their upcoming album, destined to be in headphones near you as of March 2015. San Cisco's self titled debut differs in sound from this single, but is also a pretty spectacular listen.</p>
            <a href="https://soundcloud.com/yokoandtheohnos/nobody-wants-to-know" target="_blank"><h2>Yoko and the Oh No's - Nobody Wants to Know</h2></a>
              <p>Yoko and the Oh No's are a band from Chicago that sport a bit of a retro vibe. I stumbled across this band by mistake and had to give them a listen solely because of the name. Somtimes judging a book by it's cover works out in your favor. If you like this track, you'll be happy to know that there are a few more available for your listening pleasure on their <a href="https://soundcloud.com/yokoandtheohnos" target="_blank">Soundcloud</a> page.</p>
