          <h2>Why Does This Blog Exist?</h2>
          <img alt="me" src="img/me.png"/>
          <p>Yes, I know. This is just what the Internet needs: another music blog. I am not Pitchfork or [insert your favorite music resource here], I'm just here to blog about music and music related things that I enjoy. If anything, this blog should serve as an outlet for my infatuation with music, so that my friends and family can have a bit of a reprieve from my constant rambling. In other words, that time that I saw Weezer play the Blue Album in it's entirety at Riot Fest (etc.) should no longer be a topic of conversation with people who simply don't care.</p>
          <p>I try to avoid music elitism. I have a healthy amount of what may be considered "guilty pleasures," so I'm not out to criticize the preferences of anyone else. On that note, I feel I should mention that I will never post anything negative about an artist. Artists that I don't like will simply not be a topic of discussion. One of my biggest criticisms for music blogs is the fact that so many of them waste their energy writing about things that they hate rather than those that they enjoy. There are very few genres of music that I dislike, but most of my focus is devoted to rock or any sub-genre or rock.</p>
          <p>I started listening to Green Day when I was 10 years old, and my music obsession just exploded from there. I picked up a guitar at age 10 as well, and joined band (flute) when I started middle school. Loving music has given me so many opportunities, one of my favorites being all of the traveling I get to do when I'm attending shows. Like many music enthusiasts, I collect vinyl records and enjoy blowing my paycheck on Record Store Day.</p>
          <p id ="final">I'd be lying if I said this blog wasn't for me. I keep track of show's that I've been to on the <a href="concerts.html">"Concerts"</a> page. Though all of the content here is basically like a personal journal, I'd love to hear <a href="contact.html">opinions or feedback.</a></p>
